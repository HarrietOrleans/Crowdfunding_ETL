# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2
On this project, our focus was to practice ETL(Extract,Transform, and Load). Rebecca Skinner and Harriet Orleans worked in partnership to build an ETL pipeline based on crowdfunding information provided, using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data into csv files.
From there we were able to use the created csv files to create an ERD in Quick DBD and load our data into a table schema in Postgres to display the cleaned files.
Cites: Class activities from our earlier weeks as well as weeks 9,10,and 13. Additionally, we used Xpert learning assistant and internet resources such as Stack overflow.
